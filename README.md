# mind trace
This file represents something like footprints of myself in my mind. Somestimes I intentionally leave obvious footprints for the benefits of my future self(and hopefully other people too), and or because I chose to temporarily unload references that doesn't require quick access off of my mind's working memory. Other times I just code away without leaving any trace.
