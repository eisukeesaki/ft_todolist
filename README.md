# mind trace

This file is like a trace of my mind. I maintain it for several purposes.

- organize the problem in order to solve it
- for the benefit of my future self(and hopefully other people as well)
  - to use it as a knowledge base
  - to quickly remember the status of the project

It is not comprehensive.

## knowledge base

        except it allows use of async functions as route handlers

curl
    set Cookie request header
        --cookie
        example
            curl -v --cookie "USER_TOKEN=Yes" http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## issues

- identify the main issue that you are trying to solve
- define minimum viable solution
- recursively break down the main issue into smaller, more specific sub-issues until you know the exact code-level solution for a particular issue
- code
  - code a little, test a little, repeat
      - sizeof "little" will incrementally become larger as your skill develops
- reassess issues
- repeat

## ?

Things to investigate later.

```

when making queries to PostgreSQL via node-postgres, logs of database activities are not written to /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log. the logs are written when querying from psql.
    why?

Set-Cookie header set by ?express-session has additional values concatenated to req.sessionID.
    what is it?
    how is it generated?
